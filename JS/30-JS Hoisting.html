<!-- JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.

In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

Example 1 gives the same result as Example 2:

Example 1 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      x = 5; // Assign 5 to x

      elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
      elem.innerHTML = x; // Display x in the element

      var x; // Declare x
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- The let and const Keywords
Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.

The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared:

Example
This will result in a ReferenceError: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>
    <p>With <b>let</b>, you cannot use a variable before it is declared.</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      try {
        carName = "Saab";
        let carName = "Volvo";
      } catch (err) {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err;
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>

    <p>With <b>const</b>, you cannot use a variable before it is declared.</p>
    <p>Try to remove the //.</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      carName = "Volvo";
      //const carName;
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
