<!-- The "use strict" Directive
The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5.

It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.

The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".

With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.
 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>With "use strict":</h2>
    <h3>Using a variable without declaring it, is not allowed.</h3>

    <p>Activate debugging in your browser (F12) to see the error report.</p>

    <script>
      "use strict";
      x = 3.14; // This will cause an error (x is not defined).
    </script>
  </body>
</html>


<!-- Future Proof!
Keywords reserved for future JavaScript versions can NOT be used as variable names in strict mode.

These are:

implements
interface
let
package
private
protected
public
static
yield -->
