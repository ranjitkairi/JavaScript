The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.

(Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2 ..)

This example uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      var day;
      switch (new Date().getDay()) {
        case 0:
          day = "Sunday";
          break;
        case 1:
          day = "Monday";
          break;
        case 2:
          day = "Tuesday";
          break;
        case 3:
          day = "Wednesday";
          break;
        case 4:
          day = "Thursday";
          break;
        case 5:
          day = "Friday";
          break;
        case 6:
          day = "Saturday";
      }
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Today is " + day;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
