<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

<p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by a computer.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x, y, z;  // Statement 1
x = 5;        // Statement 2
y = 6;        // Statement 3
z = x + y;    // Statement 4

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The value of z is " + z + ".";  
</script>

</body>
</html>


<!-- Semicolons ;
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

<p>JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons.</p>

<p id="demo1"></p>

<script>
var a, b, c;
a = 5;
b = 6;
c = a + b;
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = c;
</script>

</body>
</html>


<!-- JavaScript White Space
JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

The following lines are equivalent: -->

var person = "Hege";
var person="Hege";


<!-- JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator: -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

<p>
The best place to break a code line is after an operator or a comma.
</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";
</script>

</body>
</html>


<!-- JavaScript Code Blocks
JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

<p>JavaScript code blocks are written between { and }</p>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>

<p id="demo1"></p>
<p id="demo2"></p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
  document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
