<!-- JavaScript Comments
JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.
 -->

<!-- Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with //.

Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before each code line: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1 id="myH"></h1>
    <p id="myP"></p>

    <script>
      // Change heading:
      document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "JavaScript Comments";
      // Change paragraph:
      document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      var x = 5; // Declare x, give it the value of 5
      var y = x + 2; // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2
      // Write y to demo:
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = y;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1 id="myH"></h1>
    <p id="myP"></p>

    <script>
      /*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
*/
      document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "JavaScript Comments";
      document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
