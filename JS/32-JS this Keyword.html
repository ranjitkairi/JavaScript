    <h2>The JavaScript <i>this</i> Keyword</h2>

    <p>In this example, <b>this</b> represents the <b>person</b> object.</p>
    <p>Because the person object "owns" the fullName method.</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      // Create an object:
      var person = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        id: 5566,
        fullName: function () {
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        },
      };

      // Display data from the object:
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.fullName();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- What is this?
The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

It has different values depending on where it is used:

In a method, this refers to the owner object.
Alone, this refers to the global object.
In a function, this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object. -->

<!-- this Alone
When used alone, the owner is the Global object, so this refers to the Global object.

In a browser window the Global object is [object Window]:

Example -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>The JavaScript <i>this</i> Keyword</h2>

    <p>In this example, <b>this</b> refers to the window Object:</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      var x = this;
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- this in Event Handlers
In HTML event handlers, this refers to the HTML element that received the event:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>The JavaScript <i>this</i> Keyword</h2>

    <button onclick="this.style.display='none'">Click to Remove Me!</button>
  </body>
</html>
