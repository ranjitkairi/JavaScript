<!-- JavaScript Objects
Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods
In real life, a car is an object.

A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:

Object	Properties	Methods
	
car.name = Fiat

car.model = 500

car.weight = 850kg

car.color = white	
car.start()

car.drive()

car.brake()

car.stop()
All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.

All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

<!-- JavaScript Objects
You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.

This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:
 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      // Create and display a variable:
      var car = "Fiat";
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = car;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- 
This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car:
 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      // Create an object:
      var car = { type: "Fiat", model: "500", color: "white" };

      // Display some data from the object:
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The car type is " + car.type;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- Object Definition
You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:

Example -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      // Create an object:
      var person = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        age: 50,
        eyeColor: "blue",
      };

      // Display some data from the object:
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
        person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!
When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object:

var x = new String();        // Declares x as a String object
var y = new Number();        // Declares y as a Number object
var z = new Boolean();       // Declares z as a Boolean object -->
