JavaScript Events
HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

<!-- 
 In the following example, an onclick attribute (with code), is added to a <button> element: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=Date()">
      The time is?
    </button>

    <p id="demo"></p>
  </body>
</html>
